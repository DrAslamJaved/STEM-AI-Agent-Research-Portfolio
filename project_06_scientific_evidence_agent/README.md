# Scientific Evidence Verification and Citation-Audit Agent

## Objective

Evaluate whether a claim-level retrieve-rerank-verify-audit pipeline reduces
unsupported scientific assertions relative to a direct retrieval-augmented
generation baseline. The project uses SciFact for retrieval, evidence-rationale,
and stance-verification evaluation.

## Current phase

Phase 01 establishes the reproducible project boundary, research contract, and
testable runtime data-safety rules. No SciFact data, models, or experimental
results are included in this commit.

## Non-negotiable evaluation rule

The runtime agent may use only a claim's identifier and text. SciFact gold
`evidence` and `cited_doc_ids` are evaluator-only fields and must never reach
retrieval, reranking, or verification code.

## Quick start

```powershell
py -3.12 -m venv .venv
& .\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip
& .\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
& .\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest -q
& .\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m evidence_agent contract
```

## Repository layout

```text
configs/       Deterministic experiment configuration
data/          Raw, interim, and processed data boundaries
docs/          Research protocol, architecture, and evaluation contract
src/           Installable Python package
tests/         Unit and integration tests
validation/    Provenance and validation evidence
reports/       Human-readable experimental reports
results/       Machine-readable final experimental outputs
agent_trace/   Phase-level decision and verification trace
```

## Planned commands

`validate-data`, `build-index`, and `evaluate` are intentionally registered but
not yet implemented. They become available only after the corresponding tested
phases are completed.
